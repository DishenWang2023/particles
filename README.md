# Particles
* Gamma: The most abundant particle that attracts to each other and orbits around Zeta if in close proximity.

* Delta: This particle when in close proximity to each other will drive each other in the average velocity vector direction. Delta particles also repel from Gamma particles.

* Zeta: This particle follows a force field visible from the debug draw and will repel from each other if close proximity.
